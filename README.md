# PWLSD - Papers We Love San Diego

This is the repository for the San Diego chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/nashville/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

PWLSD is organized via a meetup: <https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-San-Diego/>

This meetup is a regional chapter of [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/). The general format is that once a month one member will present one computer science paper using e.g. speech, slides, demonstration. Attendees are encouraged, but not required, to read and digest the paper in advance of the meeting.

One goal is to help bridge the gap between San Diego industry and academics: membership of both types are very welcome. Another goal is to dive deep into interesting programming topics: new and old (but still relevant).
